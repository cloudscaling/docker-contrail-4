# Building containers

## Quickstart
* get Ubuntu 16 or Centos 7 with internet connection
* get the project sources (e.g. with *git clone*)
* run *setup-for-build.sh*
* re-login to renew user permissions
* run *build.sh*

At the result you get Docker registry run on 5000 port on the machine, which registry has built Contrail containers.
